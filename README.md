## Project Overview
easy download and access your Content .Supporting Multiple plateforms.
 
## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Node.js**: Required for running the frontend/server.
- **Python 3.10 or later**: Required for the backend and handling media downloads.
- **pip**: Python package manager.
- **npm**: Node.js package manager.
- **Requirements packages**: Upgrade packages only if required .

If you don't have Node.js or Python installed, visit the following pages for installation guides:

- [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Install Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the tool on your local machine.

### Setting up Python Environment

1**Create a Virtual Environment**:  
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Then, create a virtual environment.

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project

   # Create the virtual environment
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate

### Key Points:

- **Step 1**: You first create and activate a virtual environment for Python dependencies.
- **Step 2**: You install the necessary Node.js dependencies (`npm install`), followed by running the dev server (`npm run dev`).
- **Step 3**: You install Python dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the `/server` directory.
- **Step 4**: You run the application using either the Python backend (`python your_backend_script.py`) or the frontend/server   Using (`npm run dev`).

Make sure you adjust the file paths or commands based on your actual project structure (e.g., which Python script or server is run by default).
